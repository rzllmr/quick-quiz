# Quick Quiz
> A game of generated quizzes with Node.js.

Utilizing a bigger screen for the moderation and individual smartphones as game controllers, the game aims for easy setup in the local area network. The questions will be generated from databases throughout the internet, so nobody has to prepare these and would therefor be excluded from the game itself.

## Build instructions

The project requires an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). All additional modules listed in the _packages.json_ are obtained automatically by executing the following line in the working tree root directory:

```sh
npm start
```

This will instantiate a slim server listening on port __8080__ to manage the game.
